Deep Implementation:

Patient Monitoring Colony:

```python
class MedicalAntColony:
    def __init__(self, patient_id):
        self.vital_scouts = [
            HeartRateMonitor(), 
            BloodPressureTracker(),
            OxygenSaturationSensor()
        ]
        self.diagnostic_workers = [
            TrendAnalyzer(),
            PatternMatcher(), 
            RiskPredictor()
        ]
        self.alert_soldiers = [
            CriticalAlertSystem(),
            CareTeamNotifier(),
            InterventionRecommender()
        ]
    
    def monitor_patient(self):
        while True:
            # Continuous vital monitoring
            readings = {}
            for scout in self.vital_scouts:
                readings[scout.metric] = scout.collect_reading()
            
            # Collective analysis
            health_score = 0
            for worker in self.diagnostic_workers:
                health_score += worker.analyze(readings)
            
            # Trigger alerts if needed
            if health_score < self.threshold:
                for soldier in self.alert_soldiers:
                    soldier.activate(readings, health_score)
```
